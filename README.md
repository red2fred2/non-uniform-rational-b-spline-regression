# NURBS regression
This is a playground for me to try and use simulated annealing or something to test out NURBS for high dimension function regression.

Will it work? I dunno.

Will I finish it? I'll probably forget about it tomorrow.

Did I think about using polynomials and a multivariate chebyshev approximation? Yes, but it suffers badly from the curse of dimensionality.
